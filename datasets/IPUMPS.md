Shuojia says:
"The data I used to study women in STEM is from IPUMS Higher Ed. I am not authorized to redistributed it and have been citing it in my report. Just a kind reminder that if our meetup decide to dig deeper within the same data set ( it could be very interesting to work on some other data set since this one is limited to scientists and engineers and does not contain geographic details),  data extract and citing would be done properly. Anyways, hope you guys have a good one!"
