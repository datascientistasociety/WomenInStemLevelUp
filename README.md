For inspiration on additional variables of interest, read The Book of Why by Judea Pearl, pp. 304-316: in a case of gender discrimination, no discrimination was found when the variable of interest was <<Department>>. But when an additional variable of interest, <<State of Residence>> was illuminated, discrimination was more obvious.
