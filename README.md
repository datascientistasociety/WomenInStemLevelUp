# WomenInStemLevelUp

Shuojia's Original Project at https://github.com/shuojiashi/women_in_stem

SUMMARY
Using the IPUMPS data set, Shuojia observed:
1. There is an upward trend with more women taking a share of STEM jobs.
2. **Gender** was shown to yeild statistically significant findings in terms of:
  unemployment - women were more unemployed, gap at 0.5%
  pay gap - women were paid less, gap at 30%
  job satifaction - women were less satisfied, gap at 1%
3. Salary was predictable, with **size of employer** and **degree** as contributing variables. **Location** was not available.
4. Job Field was predictable, with **major** and **degree level** as contributing variables. 

COMPLIMENTS TO SHUOJIA 

*Thank you for sharing your project with us. It was a great topic with many variables of interest, which clearly engaged all of us in discussion. We like how you thought to ask how the analysis could be used afterward, such as use by college or by Linked in, and how this thinking led to two models, one to predict salary and one to predict career path. We appreciate that you thought about the location as an important angle, even though it wasnâ€™t available in the data. We found it to be an inspiring project.*



For inspiration on additional variables of interest, read The Book of Why by Judea Pearl, pp. 304-316: in a case of gender discrimination, no discrimination was found when the variable of interest was *Department*. But when an additional variable of interest, *State of Residence* was illuminated, discrimination was more obvious.
